                    <p>Over the past few years I have become something of a comedy junky, probably as a way of getting some relief from the constant deluge of negative news and the pandemic time warp. But also because at the end of a long work day, I just usually want to laugh. And although comedy is rarely seen as prestige entertainment, I am in awe of the way a skillful comic can weave powerful insights and deeply poignant revelations into a set that is so funny, I can’t help but fully release the stress of the day through some full belly laughs.</p> 
                    <p>In an age where there are more Netflix comedy specials than you can digest in a lifetime, it can be overwhelming to dip your toes into the genre—I hope that these suggestions can serve as a helpful place to start, and if you find any comedy treasure out there, I hope you’ll send your tips my way.</p>

                While I love a good standup special, at roughly 60 minutes, I often feel like I am just starting to fall in love with a comic when their set comes to an end. But thankfully, many of my favorite comedians have recounted the long form of their journey as memoirs. These harrowing tales, which I most frequently enjoy in audio book form (read aloud by the comic herself) are not only hilarious, but honestly usually pretty inspiring. It seems pretty brutal to try to make it in stand-up: from the relentless schedule to the sociopathic of jeering from hecklers (or worse, a kind but silent audience), I love hearing about their seemingly masochistic commitment to their craft, and how even the biggest names in comedy have felt like utter failures for the majority of their career. It’s both comforting and inspiring, and while there are many I would overall recommend, my top pick is probably Kevin Harte’s memoir I Can’t Make This Up. He will make you laugh out loud in a way that will be embarrassing if you’re reading (or listening to the audiobook) in public.

                        With the pandemic forcing comedians to hold off on live stand-up, it’s seems like every other week someone was deciding they were going to dedicate their comedic energy to the world of podcasting. And, while quality varies quite a bit, there are a few great new series out there that I hope survive pandemic times. Although most of these podcast ventures have adopted a structure that is part interview, part casual chit-chat (often about some shared showbiz memory), there are a few shows that are more carefully written and produced. Ultimately, regardless of the level of production, these podcasts give comedians a space to more fully unpack the absurdity of the current moment, and share their guests (and audiences) more immediate joys and challenges.
